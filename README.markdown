## Tileify WMS Proxy

This is a node application that uses [tileify-wms](https://github.com/JasonSanford/tileify-wms) to create a simple proxy for serving up WMS map services as map tiles that can be easily added to any slippy map (Leaflet, OpenLayers, Google Maps).

### Install - Run

```
cd /path/to/tileify-wms-proxy
npm install
npm start
```

#### The Slightly Harder But Still Really Easy Way

The `Procfile` makes this application easy to deploy to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

```
cd /path/to/tileify-wms-proxy
heroku create
git push heroku master
```

### Usage

After running your application visit the application root (`http://localhost:5000/`) for some documentation and an interactive demo.

The tiling proxy can be found at `http://localhost:5000/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}`. Those funny looking letters are placholders for the tiles located at specific zoom levels and coordinates. Your [mapping library](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#tilelayer) should automatically replace these with actual values at runtime.

There is one required URL parameter to add, `url`. This is the WMS map service.

This value you add to the URL **should be URL encoded!**

You can URL encode by doing:

```javascript
var wms_url = 'http://gis.srh.noaa.gov/arcgis/services/NDFDTemps/MapServer/WMSServer';
var encoded = encodeURIComponent(wms_url);
console.log(encoded);
// http%3A%2F%2Fgis.srh.noaa.gov%2Farcgis%2Fservices%2FNDFDTemps%2FMapServer%2FWMSServer
```

An example URL looks like:

    http://localhost:5000/{z}/{x}/{y}?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgis.srh.noaa.gov%2Farcgis%2Fservices%2FNDFDTemps%2FMapServer%2FWMSServer

#### Additional URL Parameters

In addition to the required `url` URL parameter, you can also pass a `&redirect=true` parameter that will perform an HTTP redirect to the map server instead of serving it itself.

Also accepted are any [WMS URL parameters](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wms/reference.html) supported by your WMS server. This software makes no attempt to enforce the (somewhat confusing) WMS URL parameters across the various versions implemented in the wild. But good luck!
